#### PROJECT NAME: Predicting NICU Admissions for Pregnancies During COVID-19
##### PROBLEM STATEMENT : This project aims to develop a predictive model for identifying high-risk pregnancies that may require NICU admission during the COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing maternal demographics, mental health indicators, and pregnancy details, we seek to determine which factors most strongly correlate with NICU admissions and compare multiple models to identify the most effective approach for this clinical prediction task.
#### Dataset : This Dataset aimed to understand the impact of COVID-19-related stresses on pregnant individuals and their infants and collected survey-based data across Canada as part of the Pregnancy during the COVID-19 Pandemic (PdP) project.
#### Models used
#### 1.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
#### 2.Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
#### 3.Decision Tree Classifier
#### 4.Artificial Neural Network (ANN - MLPClassifier)
#### 5.Random Forest Classifier
#### 6.KMeans Clustering (unsupervised – used for exploratory analysis)
#### 7.Agglomerative Clustering (unsupervised – used for exploratory analysis)
